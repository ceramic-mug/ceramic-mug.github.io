My name is Joshua Eastman. I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia. My life is rooted on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus and aims to glorify Him and serve others. My mission is **to improve the health and well-being of vulnerable communities around the world through excellent medical practice, the development of free, universal, and dependable healthcare systems, and meaningful, interdisciplinary research.** 

My passions include:

- History, particularly pre-modern
- Literature
- Exploration
- Logic
- Computer science, particularly low-level optimization, geoinformatics, computational modeling, and resource-limited solutions
- Coffee

The name of this blog comes from the New Testament of the Christian Bible, in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, specifically verse 6:

`"But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us."`

My blog title "Ceramic Mug" is a play on the verse's image "jars of clay," which Paul, the author of this passage, is using to represent the Christian as an empty, earthen vessel that's filled with the Holy Spirit. I thought "Ceramic Mug" was fitting because of how much I like coffee, while intersecting with the Biblical idea that all I am is a ceramic mug, and that when I'm shattered I can be a testimony to the power of God and resurrection of Jesus.

"ceramic_mug" is also my Xbox-live username.

I currently study Medicine at Marshall University Joan C Edwards School of Medicine in Huntington, WV, and will pursue a primary care specialty, likely combined Internal Medicine, Pediatrics (Med-Peds) or Family Medicine. I previously studied [Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.princeton.edu) at Princeton University in New Jersey for undergraduate. My intention is to marry the technical, systems-thinking of environmental engineering with medical and clinical knowledge to address grand challenges in health prevention and infrastructure at population scale.
