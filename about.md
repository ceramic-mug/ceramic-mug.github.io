My name is Joshua Eastman. I grew up in Huntington, West Virginia, in the love of my family and my home church, New Baptist. My life is centered on the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, and my passions include coffee, open source computing, outdoor adventure, good books, and learning.

The name of this blog comes from the New Testament of the Christian Bible, in 2 Corinthians chapter 4, specifically verse 6:

`"But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us."`

My blog title "Ceramic Mug" is a play on the verse's image "jars of clay," which Paul, the author of this passage, is using to represent the Christian as an empty, earthen vessel that's filled with the Holy Spirit. I thought "Ceramic Mug" was fitting because of how much I like coffee, while intersecting with the Biblical idea that all I am is a ceramic mug, and that when I'm shattered I can be a testimony to the power of God and resurrection of Jesus.

"ceramic_mug" is also my Xbox-live username.

I currently study [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.princeton.edu/), [Applications of Computing](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/ugrad/overview), and [Quantitative and Computational Biology](https://www.princeton.edu/academics/area-of-study/quantitative-and-computational-biology) at Princeton University in New Jersey.

Formative authors in my life include Bill Watterson, C.S.Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkein, G.K.Chesterton, Deitrich Bonhoeffer, Glen Cook, and John Howard Yoder. I'm sure there are others that I'm not remembering right now. I'll add them to the list as they come to me.

My primary computer is a [Macbook](https://www.apple.com/macbook/) that I got in 2016. I prefer coding in either [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), browsing with [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), and using [FISH](https://fishshell.com/) for my terminal shell. I'll include a page of my favorite open source software elsewhere on this website.

This blog is built using the open-source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Jekyll is super awesome and really easy to get up and running with [Github](https://github.com/) as a free blogging platform. I'm using the base theme [minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) with increasing customization as time goes on, but there is a whole host of other Jekyll themes that you could use for your own site.
