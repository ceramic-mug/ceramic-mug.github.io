I"‹<p>When I, weary, reflect upon<br />
The longings of the human heartâ€“<br />
Sometimes so far they seem to be,<br />
Like distant land beyond the sea,<br />
Or Plutoâ€™s quiet somnolence beyond<br />
The warmth of Solâ€™s embraceâ€“<br />
The flight of thoughts<br />
Escape from mind beset<br />
By troubled daily news;<br />
And so in contemplation I<br />
Oft sink into the murky blues.</p>
