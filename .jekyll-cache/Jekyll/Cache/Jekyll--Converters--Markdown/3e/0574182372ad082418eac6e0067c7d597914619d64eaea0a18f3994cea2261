<h2 id="mean-variance-and-standard-deviation-from-n-direct-measurements">Mean, variance, and standard deviation from $n$ direct measurements</h2>

<p>The mean $\bar x$ is calculated as:</p>

\[\bar x = \sum_i \frac{x_i}{n}\]

<p>Where $\bar x$ is the mean, $x_i$ is the $i$-th measurement, and $n$ is the number of measurements.</p>

<p>If the true standard error $\sigma$ or variance $\sigma^2$ for the population is known, and if the mean $\bar x$ was estimated from $n$ samples, then variance of the mean $\sigma_{\bar x}^2$ can be calculated as</p>

\[\sigma_{\bar x}^2 = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}\]

<p>If the variance $S^2$ of the population is not known and must be estimated (as in most cases), then use the following equation:</p>

\[S^2 = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_i \left(x_i-\bar x\right)^2\]

<p>Where in all these equations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$\sigma$ refers to the <em>true</em> error</li>
  <li>$S$ refers to the <em>estimated</em> error</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="least-squares-linear-regression">Least-squares Linear Regression</h2>

<p>Suppose you want to fit the function</p>

\[y = a + bx\]

<p>to a set of 2D data of $n$ samples. Then parameters $a$ and $b$ can be estimated using the following equations:</p>

\[a = \frac{\sum_i x_i^2\sum_i y_i - \sum_i x_i \sum_i x_i y_i}{n\sum_i x_i^2 - \left(\sum_i x_i\right)^2}\]

\[b = \frac{n\sum_i x_i y_i - \sum_i x_i \sum y_i}{n\sum_i x_i^2 - \left(\sum_i x_i\right)^2}\]

<p>Where, for clarity, $a$ is the intercept and $b$ is the slope of the regression.</p>

<h3 id="parameter-error-estimation">Parameter error estimation</h3>

<p>The set of residuals $E$ can be defined as the set of differences between the original $y$-values and the $y$-values estimated by the regression using the original $x$-values as arguments:</p>

\[E = \{\epsilon_i : \epsilon_i = y_i - \left(a + bx_i\right), \forall (x_i, y_i)\}\]

<p>Then the variance of the regression model can be calculated as follows:</p>

\[S_{y/x}^2 = \frac{1}{n-2} \sum_i \epsilon_i^2,\;\forall \epsilon_i\in E\]

<p>And the variance of the slope $b$:</p>

\[S^2_b = \frac{S_{y/x}^2}{\sum_i\left(x_i-\bar x\right)^2}\]

<p>And the variance of the intercept $a$:</p>

\[S^2_a = S_{x/y}^2\left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar x^2}{\sum_i\left(x_i - \bar x\right)^2}\right)\]

<p>Note that the error $S$ (usually denoted $\sigma$, even when estimated) of either parameter is simply the square root of the respective variance.</p>

<p>Therefore when writing a technical paper where you produce ‚Äúerror bars‚Äù or $\pm$ standard deviation, calculate $\sigma = \sqrt{S^2}$ for each determined parameter.</p>

<h2 id="error-propagation">Error propagation</h2>

<p>Given the analytical model</p>

\[y = f\left(x_1, x_2, ..., x_3\right)\]

<p>Then the variance of the model is</p>

\[\sigma^2_y = \sum_i \frac{\sigma^2_{\bar x, i}}{x_i}\left(\frac{\partial y}{\partial x_i}\right)^2\]
