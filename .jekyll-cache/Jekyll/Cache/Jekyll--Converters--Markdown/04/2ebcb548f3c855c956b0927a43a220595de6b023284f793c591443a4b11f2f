<p>Faithful hands that hold lifelong wife<br />
And children, now grown,<br />
With children of their own;<br />
Strongly holding tools at times,<br />
Books at times, wisdom always;<br />
Failing sometimes, but seeking grace;<br />
Lifting the poor, protecting the weak,<br />
Binding up the broken,<br />
Telling an old joke for the upteenth time.</p>

<p>Grandfathers grow old no sooner<br />
Than they must,<br />
For childhood burns brighter<br />
In their smiles every year past fifty;<br />
Good food, good drink, good conversation,<br />
Goodness and blessing run down<br />
On the heads of such men.</p>

<p>Their homes are filled at times,<br />
Empty at times, when the children grow;<br />
Full again when grandchildren come<br />
And grace upon grace spreads<br />
Through the growing family tree.</p>

<p>Blessed indeed is the man<br />
Who does not walk, nor stand, nor sit<br />
In sin or idleness;<br />
Instead he delights in the Word,<br />
Sets it on his tongue,<br />
Meditates in his heart,<br />
And does good.</p>

<p>Such a man walks in faithfulness<br />
That bears the fruit of<br />
Childrenâ€™s children;<br />
Such a man holds dear<br />
The love of lifelong wife<br />
And rests peacefully,<br />
Laying down striving and<br />
Holding the joy of life everlasting.</p>
