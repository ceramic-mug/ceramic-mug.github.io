<p>This past Saturday, I had the privilege of exploring the Delaware Water Gap national recreational area with my good friend David. He and I set out around 7am Saturday morning and were able to hit the trails by nine. We started on the Appalachian trail and branched off onto other ancillary trails that spread out from there. By the end of the day, we had hiked about 15 good miles. I’ll add some pictures and maps of the hiking onto this post when I have the opportunity. I’d love to share more of it with you.</p>
