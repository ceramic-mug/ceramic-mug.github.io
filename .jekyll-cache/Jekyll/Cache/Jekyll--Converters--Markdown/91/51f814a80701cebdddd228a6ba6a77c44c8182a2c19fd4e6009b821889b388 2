I"7<p>All this time our souls believed<br />
That our hands which used to hold<br />
Perhaps another hand, or tool,<br />
Or book, now hold the mouth to running brooks<br />
Of countless ecstasies, of dreams<br />
In glowing visions of the night<br />
Which make us truly come alive,<br />
To know, to see, to make, to preen<br />
Our love-songs to a sea of souls;<br />
Instead we hold the deepest void,<br />
An opiate pall upon our hearts,<br />
Now shrouded oâ€™er the waking day<br />
By downcast eyes no more to raise<br />
To dancing spheres in darkened sky.</p>
