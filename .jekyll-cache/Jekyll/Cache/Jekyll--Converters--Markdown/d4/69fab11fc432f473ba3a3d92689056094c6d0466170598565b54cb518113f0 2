I"8<p>Five times in five minutes–<br />
No new emails,<br />
No texts,<br />
No likes;<br />
Time to check again.</p>

<p>We studied infinite loops<br />
In computer science;<br />
The basic logic is<br />
A condition<br />
That can never be fulfilled.</p>

<p>And so the machine,<br />
So programmed,<br />
Performs the same operation<br />
Again and again,<br />
In search of that necessary and sufficient<br />
condition.</p>

<p>But the machine cannot know–<br />
For it has no power of reflection–<br />
That its condition<br />
Will never be fulfilled;<br />
Always and forever false.</p>

<p>Woe is man! We are worse than the machine.<br />
For though we know<br />
And can reflect,<br />
We are, and continue to be,<br />
Trapped in infinite loops<br />
By those ingenious machines.</p>

<p>The unfeeling phone becomes our tyrant,<br />
Social media our means<br />
Of fulfilling some mysterious<br />
Necessary and sufficient condition;<br />
We must check, again.</p>

<p>What is the condition which<br />
Traps us in this loop?<br />
For what do we long for?<br />
Why do we refresh, or scroll?<br />
Why must I pull out my phone again?</p>

<p>And yet I do,<br />
Full knowing that no condition will be fulfilled;<br />
And so perpetuate the endless torment<br />
Of unfulfilled life;<br />
Trapped.</p>

<p>Where is wisdom for this infant age<br />
Of information, and the technology<br />
To harness that information?<br />
Where is wisdom to be found?<br />
In email? On Insta? YouTube tutorial, maybe?</p>

<p>Seek wisdom and be free<br />
From the tormentuous fantasy<br />
Of unfulfillable conditions;<br />
Unfulfillable, that is, by the little screens<br />
We have in our pockets.</p>

<p>The condition is, perhaps, relationship;<br />
Relationship with God and man,<br />
With beast and earth,<br />
With truth and wisdom;<br />
No sparkling screens will ever fulfill<br />
This condition.</p>

<p>And so you will remain trapped<br />
As so many do if you<br />
Keep reaching for your phone;<br />
Instead, be wise, and open your eyes;<br />
God loves you, and does fulfill.</p>
