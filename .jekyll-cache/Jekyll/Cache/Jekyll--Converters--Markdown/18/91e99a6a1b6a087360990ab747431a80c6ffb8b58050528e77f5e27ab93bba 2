I"ñ<p>When failing I<br />
Find that indeed<br />
My heart is not<br />
So strong or brave<br />
As I believed;<br />
My speech not sweet<br />
Or patience great<br />
Enough to make<br />
All people happy<br />
All the time;<br />
I find that when<br />
I honest see<br />
Myself in light<br />
Of Godâ€™s majesty<br />
I, smaller true<br />
Than I once thought<br />
Can greater drink<br />
From graceâ€™s cup<br />
And on that grace<br />
Rely in deeper<br />
And life-giving way;<br />
My childish mind<br />
Believes that I<br />
Through my own strength<br />
Unfailing can<br />
Without a trouble<br />
Or a loss<br />
Rise to become<br />
That man which<br />
God calls me to be;<br />
You see,<br />
As I now become<br />
A man<br />
I know that nothing<br />
Is so easy;<br />
Though greatest life<br />
And greatest opportunities<br />
Have been afforded me,<br />
It is not my past<br />
Nor future even<br />
That defines eternity;<br />
But present reliance<br />
On Godâ€™s grace;<br />
Present strength and courage<br />
From him derived;<br />
Present receipt of<br />
Promised communion<br />
And collaboration<br />
With the Galilean;<br />
If in himself<br />
A manâ€™s hope lies<br />
Then to himself<br />
His broken ways<br />
Will always be<br />
Before his eyes;<br />
But if in freedom<br />
True at last<br />
A man on Christ<br />
Does fully cast<br />
His sorrow and his failures he<br />
May come to find<br />
Sweet sympathy<br />
Strong courage and<br />
Unshakably<br />
Such man can live<br />
Full faithfully<br />
Not swerving to<br />
The left or right<br />
But girded for<br />
Lifeâ€™s every fight;<br />
Such a man<br />
I long to be<br />
Not by my power<br />
Or certainty<br />
But by that blood<br />
Which purchased me<br />
And by the Spirit<br />
Leading free<br />
My broken heart<br />
From slavery<br />
Strengthening<br />
My weakened knees<br />
And holding on<br />
To my weak hands,<br />
Christs strength<br />
Is strength;<br />
Otherwise,<br />
All of mine<br />
Is frailty.</p>
