I"ƒ<p>Two men sat down<br />
Beside a fire as evening came.<br />
The eyes of one were fixed unmoving<br />
On the dying flame.<br />
The other, silent, smoked a pipe<br />
And contemplated shame.</p>

<p>â€œShame,â€ said he,<br />
â€œIs wretched, and makes man wretched<br />
Who hides away their pain.â€<br />
Took he a toke three seconds long<br />
And breathed it out again<br />
So that it mingled with the flame.</p>

<p>â€œShame,â€ said he, â€œIs good, and makes man good<br />
Who to both friend and foe repent;<br />
Who, when soul is pricked by evil deed,<br />
When hope fails as this flame,<br />
Run not into the shadows,<br />
but in the light proclaim.â€</p>

<p>The other sat unmoving still<br />
In moonlight and by fire,<br />
His eyes were dead, unthinkingâ€“noâ€“<br />
Despairing of an inward foe;<br />
A shame which owned his soul outright,<br />
A shame which locked his mind in flight.</p>

<p>â€œAlone,â€ said he, in smallest voice,<br />
â€œJust like this dying flame<br />
Which before us now sends embers up.<br />
Alone and scared, and worried now,<br />
About that which you spoke, the same;<br />
That shame which makes me drink deathâ€™s cup.â€</p>

<p>Silent sat they â€˜till one red coal<br />
Glowed softly in a heap of ash.<br />
â€œOne neednâ€™t drink the cup alone,<br />
Or fear to bare their soul;<br />
Speak, for to sin atone;<br />
Share with me this drink of death.â€</p>

<p>Sat they together till morning sun<br />
Broke gently on their face;<br />
All grey the fire, and gone the night.<br />
Then he cried out, in weeping plight;<br />
The friend drew near, and wept with him;<br />
In love He gave him grace.</p>
