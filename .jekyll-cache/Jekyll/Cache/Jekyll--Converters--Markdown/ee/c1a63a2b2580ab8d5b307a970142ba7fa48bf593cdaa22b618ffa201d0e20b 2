I"š<p><em>An opening caveat: I help lead the Princeton University campus ministry called Christian Union NOVA, and believe participation in campus ministry is a significant blessing for Christian college students and important for college-age faith formation. This blog is not meant to denigrate college ministries but instead articulate my beliefs about the local Church in the context of college life.</em></p>
