I"À<p>In previous posts, Iâ€™ve mentioned that Iâ€™m working for the <a href="https://environment.princeton.edu/">Princeton Environmental Instituteâ€™s</a> Farm Project this summer. I primarily contribute to the project by operating a drone and analyzing the graphical data produced by each flight. This post provides some details about the specific drone, software, operating procedures, and image processing tools Iâ€™ve used to meet our goals.</p>
