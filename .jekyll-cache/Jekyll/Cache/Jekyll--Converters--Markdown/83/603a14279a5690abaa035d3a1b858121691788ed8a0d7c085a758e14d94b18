I"<p>The medical school admissions process is extremely difficult in a number of different ways.</p>

<p>The medical school admissions process is academically difficult, requiring you to take a broad set of math and science courses as well as rigorous organic and biochemistry â€“ all during undergraduate years (unless you choose to take some courses post-baccelaureate).</p>

<p>The medical school admissions process is financially difficult: the MCAT (Medicall College Admissions Test) costs around $300 dollars and good study materials cost &gt;$200; AMCAS (the American Medical College Application Service) primary application costs $170 for the first school and $40 for additional schools (the average number of schools applied to is over 20, so $170 + 19 * $40 = $930); per-school secondary applications cost an average $95 (for 20 schools, thatâ€™s a total of $1900). A normal (non-COVID) application cycle requires the applicant to travel to schools for interview, incurring hundreds of dollars of travel cost per interview. In all, the application process alone costs upwards of $3,500, not including travel costs.</p>

<p>The medical school admissions process is also time-intensive. Before applying, a <em>good</em> applicant will spend hundreds of hours job-shadowing physician(s), conducting research, doing community service, and working/volunteering in a clinic setting. A <em>good</em> applicant will also have studied for hundreds of hours for the MCAT. The AMCAS primary application takes on the order of dozens of hours, and completing the full litany of secondary applications takes another dozens of hours. Interviews are the shortest part of the process, lasting from around 20 minutes to four hours. In all, a <em>good</em> medical school applicant will spend upwards of 500+ hours resume building (shadowing, conducting research, etc.), studying, and completing the application itself.</p>

<p>In the previous paragraph, I use the italicized word <em>good</em> not to refer to the applicant who will necessarily be the best student or the best doctor, but to refer to the applicant who <em>looks the best</em> to medical schools. The <em>good</em> applicant is the one most likely to be accepted. Note that this is not without warrant; ostensibly, a student who has spent time shadowing, volunteering, studying, and putting work in on the application is dedicated to being a physician. But this begs the question: if a person does <em>not</em> spend as much time, or does not have opportunities to, shadow, perform research, etc.â€“or, rather, if a student chooses not to, and instead spends their free time before beginning a life of medical work exploring other jobs, research, or adventure-related endeavorsâ€“whoâ€™s to say that student will be any less of a good medical student or physician? The expectation that a student will spend the majority of their time pursuing medicine <em>before they formally begin pursuing medicine</em> unecessarily constrains the breadth of student experience upon entering medical school.</p>
