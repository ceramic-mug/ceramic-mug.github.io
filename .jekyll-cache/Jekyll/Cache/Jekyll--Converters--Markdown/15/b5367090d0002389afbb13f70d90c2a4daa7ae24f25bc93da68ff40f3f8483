I"è<p>The medical school admissions process is difficult. This short essay reflects on my experience through the process. I am confident that no two people approach medical school admissions the same way; no two people share the same academic background, financial situations, inclinations, experience, study habits, or school choices. There is therefore no one-size-fits-all guide to the process.</p>
