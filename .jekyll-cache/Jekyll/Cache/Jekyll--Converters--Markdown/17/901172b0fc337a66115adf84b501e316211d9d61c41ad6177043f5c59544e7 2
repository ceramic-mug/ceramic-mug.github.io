I"Y<p>Dense deciduous forests form the backdrop of childhood memories. West Virginia–my home–is covered in trees. I don’t think I was ever outdoors without a tree being within sight. And usually not one, but tens of thousands covering the hills with canopies thick and heavy with foliage in summer, then a cacophony of reds and orange in fall, and labyrinthine branches in wintertime. Trees seemed as abundant and eternal as the earth itself. And I of course paid the trees no mind. Like the air or water, trees were simply an unchanging, integral part of the world that needed no explanation.</p>
