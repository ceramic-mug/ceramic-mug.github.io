I"]<p>When I, weary, reflect upon<br />
The longings of the human heart–<br />
Sometimes so far they seem to be,<br />
Like distant land beyond the sea,<br />
Or Pluto’s quiet somnolence beyond<br />
The warmth of Sol’s embrace–<br />
The flight of thoughts<br />
Escape from mind beset<br />
By troubled daily news;<br />
And so in contemplation I<br />
Oft sink into the murky blues.</p>

<p>What hope for man,<br />
When sin and pain abound,<br />
When sorrow seems to know no end,<br />
And oppression ever hounds<br />
The weak, the innocent, the poor;<br />
And those who tend<br />
To other’s needs<br />
Burn out and find their lives<br />
Spread like tattered rugs<br />
upon a boundless floor?<br />
What hope for children who<br />
Know neither joy nor confidence,<br />
Whose life is sapped by those who hold<br />
Their attention rapt to tiny screens;<br />
Hopeless it sometimes seems.</p>

<p>Through rumination I conclude<br />
If hope depends on such as me<br />
Then hopeless true<br />
This world would be;<br />
So agrees the preacher<br />
In old Ecclesiaste;<br />
Vanity of vanities! All must be<br />
If all was up to you and me.</p>

<p>But wait, and look:<br />
Do you, too, see<br />
The man upon the waves?<br />
One foot upon the surf,<br />
The other on the clouds of power;<br />
A rod in hand to strike the nations<br />
And break the corporations<br />
At the judgement hour;<br />
Like potter’s vessels thrown upon the land,<br />
So too will evil break beneath His hand<br />
Still scarred from Calvary’s hill;<br />
Justice and peace writ large upon His thigh<br />
And fiercest love ablaze in piercing eye;
He came to set the captives free–<br />
As captives all in death’s strong hand we<br />
Languish now as in His day if<br />
Trusting not His outstretched hand<br />
We go our separate way–<br />
And with His blood to stay,<br />
The wrath of God.</p>

<p>So seeing I, in fear and hope,<br />
Can find the strength for one more day;<br />
For in the Galilean I<br />
Have known fulfilled the promise true<br />
Of hope, and of a future;<br />
Not for me only, but for you too.</p>
