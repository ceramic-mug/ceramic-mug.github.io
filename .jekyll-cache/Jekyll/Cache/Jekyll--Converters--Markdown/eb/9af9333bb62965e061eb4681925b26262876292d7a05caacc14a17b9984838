I"k<p>The medical school admissions process is difficult. This short essay reflects on my experience through the process. I am confident that no two people approach medical school admissions the same way; no two people share the same academic background, financial situations, inclinations, experience, study habits, or school choices. There is therefore no one-size-fits-all guide to the process. This essay is a reflection, not a guide, though perhaps sharing my experience can help you avoid some of my shortcomings if you too are applying or shore up an argument for or against changes in the application system.</p>
