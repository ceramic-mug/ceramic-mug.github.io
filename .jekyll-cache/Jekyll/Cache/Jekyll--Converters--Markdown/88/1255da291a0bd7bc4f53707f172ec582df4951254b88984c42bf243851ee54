I"¨<p>Summer, 2019 was my first encounter with drones and aerial photography. I worked with <a href="https://eeb.princeton.edu/people/daniel-rubenstein">Daniel Rubensteinâ€™s</a> Lab at Princeton University to capture RGB (regular photo) and NIR (Near Infrared) imagery of local farms. For this work, I operated a DJI Phantom Pro 4 v2. You can read more about that experience <a href="/2019/07/11/DroneWork.html">here</a>.</p>
