I"`<p>All this time our souls believed<br />
That our hands which used to hold<br />
Perhaps another hand, or tool,<br />
Or book, now hold the mouth to running brooks<br />
Of countless ecstasies, of dreams<br />
In glowing visions of the night<br />
Which make us truly come alive,<br />
To know, to see, to make, to preen<br />
Our love-songs to a sea of souls;<br />
Instead we hold the deepest void,<br />
An opiate pall upon our hearts,<br />
Now shrouded o’er the waking day<br />
By downcast eyes no more to raise<br />
To dancing spheres in darkened sky.</p>

<p>I cry, no more! Whence have our souls<br />
Once lovely in the broken light<br />
Of broken world made lovely through<br />
Communion shared by souls anew<br />
Each day; now souls consumed<br />
By TicTok, Twitter, raging news,<br />
The Gram’s eternal, mindless feed,<br />
By YouTube’s powerful clutching hands,<br />
By games empowered by our greed;<br />
These bricks of metal, glass, and steam<br />
Which glow with eerie bluish cast<br />
Upon our weakened eyes and minds–<br />
Whence have they chosen now instead<br />
To be caught in this insidious spell?<br />
These machines which we have birthed<br />
Have so quick our poor minds usurped.</p>

<p>But worst of all, we really see<br />
In all the screens on all the walls<br />
In all the hands in all the halls<br />
In all the news and all the feeds<br />
Ourselves; indeed<br />
The world which we think we hate<br />
Which drives us to such deep despair,<br />
Is really just our own reflection;<br />
My trembling, fearful soul laid bare<br />
Is what I send when I tap “share.”</p>
