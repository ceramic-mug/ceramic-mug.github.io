I"‘<p>After hitting snooze on my alarm clock a bajillion times this morning, I got up, got ready, and brewed myself a cup of coffee. I didnâ€™t have time to make breakfast (and our dorm buildingâ€™s kitchen was probably full), so I grabbed a leaf of Swiss Chard out of our little fridge and ran to the lab. The next few hours (9-12) were spent looking through a low-powered microscope at sticky-traps full of bugs, trying to identify salient features of the insects and enter those into a spreadsheet. I ran back to the dorm, made myself some lunch, threw the leftovers into a tupperware, and then went back to the lab for our afternoon fieldwork session.</p>
