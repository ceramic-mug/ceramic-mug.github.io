## Nitrification

Adapted from [EPA Wastewater Management Fact Sheet](https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2019-08/documents/denitrifying_filters_fact_sheet_p100il79.pdf)

Nitrification refers to the conversion of ammonium $\ce{NH3}$ to nitrite $\ce{NO2-}$ and nitrate $\ce{NO3-}$. This process generally occurs in two steps orchestrated by different species of bacteria.

### Step 1: $\ce{NH3 -> NO2-}$

*Nitrosomonas*, *Nitrosococcus*, and *Nitrosospira* bacteria, among others, convert ammonium to nitrite according to the following stochiometric equation:

$$
\ce{NH3 + O2 -> NO2- + 3H+ + 2e-}
$$

### Step 2: $\ce{NO2- -> NO3-}$

*Nitrobacter*, *Nitrospina*, *Nitrococcus*, and *Nitrospira* bacteria, among others, convert nitrite to nitrate according to the following stochiometric equation:

$$
\ce{NO2- + H2O -> NO3- + 2H+ + 2e-}
$$

## Denitrification

Denitrification is the reduction of nitrites and nitrates to gas-form Nitrogen according to the following equations (Metcalf and Eddy, 1979):

Step 1:

$$
\ce{6NO3- + 2CH3OH -> 6NO2- + 2CO2 + 4H2O}
$$

Step 2:

$$
\ce{6NO2- + 3CH3OH -> 3N2 + 3CO2 + 3H2O + 6OH-}
$$

Which combine in the overall reaction scheme

$$
\ce{6NO3- + 5CH3OH -> 5CO2 + 3N2 + 7H2O + 6OH-}
$$
