title: 🌅 The Meaning of Easter-week Celebrations

Many people grow up going to Church or have friends who participate in Church. There tend to be two large holiday seasons celebrated widely in the Church--Easter and Christmas. Both of these seasons are surrounded by a lot of cultural and religious ritual.

The Christian story behind Christmas is, I think, easier to understand than the Easter season. The Christmas season celebrates the birth of Jesus, who Christians believe to be God incarnate. But what is Easter? And what are all the strange mini-holidays that happen on Easter week? These mini-holidays include:

- **Palm Sunday** (the Sunday before Easter)
- **Maundy Thursday** (the Thursday before Easter)
- **Good Friday** (the Friday before Easter)
- **Easter**

Each of these mini-holidays point to specific moments in the life of Jesus leading up to His death and resurrection. The purpose of this blog post is to help connect the dots between each of these these celebrations, the rituals that often accompany them, and the historical events in the week of Jesus' death and resurrection. I will do this by sharing the passages from each of the four Gospels (the books in the Bible that record the life of Jesus) that correspond to each mini-holidays with brief clarifying comments about specific aspects of Christains' modern celebrations or language in the text.

Generally, Christian holidays, and the rituals that accompany them, are all about **remembering** something that God has done. Specifically, Christians celebrate and **remember** those things that have been documented and transmitted in the form of written word in the Bible.

*Note: I will use the New Revised Standard Version (NRSV) for all quotations from the Bible. The NRSV is the Egnlish translation [most commonly used by Biblical scholars.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_English_Bible_translations)*

# 🌿 What is Palm Sunday?

Palm Sunday is celebrated the Sunday before Easter. Churches tend to celebrate Palm Sunday by waving big palm branches around at some point during their worship service. In the Church where I grew up, we had a little procession of kids in preschool and elementary school walk through the sanctuary (where we held worship) carrying palm branches and shouting "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!"

In some Churches, the palm branches are subsequently burned (not during the service, but sometime after), and the ashes of the burned palm branches from one year become the ashes applied to peoples' foreheads during the following year's Ash Wednesday.

*Note: I'm not going to discuss Ash Wednesday in this post because it doesn't occur during Easter week and, more generally, does not correspond direclty to an event in Jesus' life.*

What's the biblical basis for Palm Sunday and its traditions? What's up with the palm branches and the procession of children?

**Palm Sunday celebrates Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem the week of His death and resurrection.** The traditions of waving palm branches and shouting "Hosanna!" come from descriptions of the event in the Bible. This event is recorded in all four Gospels (the Gospels are the books of the Bible that recount Jesus' life and ministry, death, and resurrection) and corresponds to prophecies in the Old Testament (the Jewish scriptures that make up the first part of the Christian Bible). Here are the descriptions from each of the Gospels:

## 📖 The Biblical record of Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem

**From the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 21:**

> When they [Jesus and his disciples] had come near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples, saying to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, "The Lord needs them.' And he will send them immediately. " This took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet, saying, "Tell the daughter of Zion, Look, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey." The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. A very large crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that followed were shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!" When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, "Who is this?" The crowds were saying, "This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth in Galilee."

**From the Gospel of Mark, chapter 11:**

> When they [Jesus and his disciples] were approaching Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples and said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately as you enter it, you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden; untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, "Why are you doing this?' just say this, "The Lord needs it and will send it back here immediately.' " They went away and found a colt tied near a door, outside in the street. As they were untying it, some of the bystanders said to them, "What are you doing, untying the colt?" They told them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it. Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields. Then those who went ahead and those who followed were shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"

**From the Gospel of Luke, chapter 19:**

> After he [Jesus] had said this, he went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. When he had come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, saying, "Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here. If anyone asks you, "Why are you untying it?' just say this, "The Lord needs it.' " So those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them. As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?" They said, "The Lord needs it." Then they brought it to Jesus; and after throwing their cloaks on the colt, they set Jesus on it. As he rode along, people kept spreading their cloaks on the road. As he was now approaching the path down from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen, saying, "Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!" Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, order your disciples to stop." He answered, "I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would shout out."

**From the Gospel of John, chapter 12:**

> The next day the great crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord— the King of Israel!" Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; as it is written: "Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!"

## 💡 Connections between texts and to modern rituals

- **Palm branches:** Three of the four Gospel accounts mention the crowd getting some kind of branch and spreading those branches on the road in front of Jesus. The writers of Matthew and Mark write "branches from the trees" and "branches that they had cut in the fields," respectively, while John's Gospel specifically mentions "branches of palm trees." John's specific designation of palm trees and the recurring scene across the Gospels of people in the crowd taking branches and laying them on the path before Jesus has led to the incorperation of palm branches into Palm Sunday, and into the name of Palm Sunday itself.
- **"Blessed is he...":** The commonly repeated phrase in Palm Sunday services is "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord." Hosanna is simply a happy or exciting shout, like "Woohoo!". The "Blessed is He..." phrase corresponds to the shouts of the crowds around Jesus as recorded in all four Gospels: 
  - **Matthew:** "*==Hosanna== to the Son of David! ==Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!== Hosanna in the highest heaven!*"
  - **Mark:** "*==Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!== Blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!*"
  - **Luke:** "==*Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord!== Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!*"
  - **John:** "*==Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord==— the King of Israel!*"

You will notice that the crowd calls Jesus "the Son of David," and relates Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem to "the coming kingdom of our ancestor David" (Matthew and Mark, respectively). The title "Son of David" refers to a specific promise that God makes with David, one of the first Kings of the nation of Israel, who was born around 1000 BCE. The promise is recorded in the book of **2 Samuel**, which is a part of the Old Testament (Jewish scriptures), and it reads like this:

> When your [David's] days are fulfilled and you lie down with your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come forth from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever.

The crowd around Jesus interprets his arrival in Jerusalem as the inaguration of the kingdom which God promised to establish through David's offspring.

- **The donkey:** As you read the accounts of Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem, it's clear that the donkey is important. All four of the Gospel writers include descriptions of the donkey, and three of the Gospels have fairly lengthy descriptions of how the donkey was acquired for Jesus. Why is the donkey so important? Note how both Matthew's and John's Gospels give us insight.

  - **Matthew:** "*==This took place to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet==, saying, "Tell the daughter of Zion, Look, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a donkey*."
  - **John:** "Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it; ==as it is written==: "Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your king is coming, sitting on a donkey's colt!""

  The writers are referring to a message the prophet Zechariah (c. 520-518 BCE) preached to the nation of Israel, recorded in the book of Zechariah in the Old Testament (**Zechariah chapter 9 verse 9**). Both of the Gospel writers quote this passage and interpret Jesus' choice to ride on a donkey as a fulfillment of Zechariah's prophecy some 500 years before.
