When I, weary, reflect upon  
The longings of the human heart--  
Sometimes so far they seem to be,  
Like distant land beyond the sea,  
Or Pluto's quiet somnolence beyond  
The warmth of Sol's embrace--  
The flight of thoughts  
Escape from mind beset  
By troubled daily news;  
And so in contemplation I  
Oft sink into the murky blues.

What hope for man,  
When sin and pain abound,  
When sorrow seems to know no end,  
And oppression ever hounds  
The weak, the innocent, the poor;  
And those who tend  
To other's needs  
Burn out and find their lives  
Spread like tattered rugs  
upon a boundless floor?  
What hope for children who  
Know neither joy nor confidence,  
Whose life is sapped by those who hold  
Their attention rapt to tiny screens;  
Hopeless it sometimes seems.  

Through rumination I conclude  
If hope depends on such as me  
Then hopeless true  
This world would be;  
So agrees the preacher  
In old Ecclesiaste;  
Vanity of vanities! All must be  
If all was up to you and me.

But wait, and look:  
Do you, too, see  
The man upon the waves?  
One foot upon the surf,  
The other on the clouds of power;  
A rod in hand to strike the nations  
And break the corporations  
At the judgement hour;  
Like potter's vessels thrown upon the land,  
So too will evil break beneath His hand  
Still scarred from Calvary's hill;  
Justice and peace writ large upon His thigh  
And fiercest love ablaze in piercing eye;
He came to set the captives free--  
As captives all in death's strong hand we  
Languish now as in His day if  
Trusting not His outstretched hand  
We go our separate way--  
And with His blood to stay,  
The wrath of God.

So seeing I, in fear and hope,  
Can find the strength for one more day;  
For in the Galilean I  
Have known fulfilled the promise true  
Of hope, and of a future;  
Not for me only, but for you too.
