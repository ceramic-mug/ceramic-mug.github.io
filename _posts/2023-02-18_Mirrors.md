All this time our souls believed  
That our hands which used to hold  
Perhaps another hand, or tool,  
Or book, now hold the mouth to running brooks  
Of countless ecstasies, of dreams  
In glowing visions of the night  
Which make us truly come alive,  
To know, to see, to make, to preen  
Our love-songs to a sea of souls;  
Instead we hold the deepest void,  
An opiate pall upon our hearts,  
Now shrouded o'er the waking day  
By downcast eyes no more to raise  
To dancing spheres in darkened sky.  

I cry, no more! Whence have our souls  
Once lovely in the broken light  
Of broken world made lovely through  
Communion shared by souls anew  
Each day; now souls consumed  
By TicTok, Twitter, raging news,  
The Gram's eternal, mindless feed,  
By YouTube's powerful clutching hands,  
By games empowered by our greed;  
These bricks of metal, glass, and steam  
Which glow with eerie bluish cast  
Upon our weakened eyes and minds--  
Whence have they chosen now instead  
To be caught in this insidious spell?  
These machines which we have birthed  
Have so quick our poor minds usurped.  

But worst of all, we really see  
In all the screens on all the walls  
In all the hands in all the halls  
In all the news and all the feeds  
Ourselves; indeed  
The world which we think we hate  
Which drives us to such deep despair,  
Is really just our own reflection;  
My trembling, fearful soul laid bare  
Is what I send when I tap "share."
