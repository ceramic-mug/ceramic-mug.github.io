# BOD Kinetics

Biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) kinetics can be well-described as a first order reaction:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial t} = -kL
$$

Where $L$ is the concentration of BOD at time $t$ (units (mass $O_2$ demand)/(volume)) and $k$ is the first-order reaction rate (units time$^{-1}$). Solving this equation gives us

$$
L = L_0e^{-kt}
$$

Since BOD is in units of mass $O_2$ per volume, the amount of oxygen utilized at any time t $y(t)$ is related to the initial BOD $L_0$ and the remaining BOD $L$:

$$
y = \Delta L = L_0 - L_t
$$

Which, when substitued into the following equation, gives

$$
y = L_0\left(1-e_{-kt}\right)
$$

Or in differential form

$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = kL_0e^{-kt}
$$

## Determining reaction rate and initial BOD conentration from observations

This final equation can be used to determine reaction rate $k$ and initial BOD concentration $L_0$ by linearizing the euqation using natural logarithm:

$$
\ln\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = \ln\left(kL_0\right)-kt
$$

This equation can be plotted to determine reaction rate $k$ and initial concentration $L_0$:

Where the slope is reaction rate $k$ and can be used along with the intercept $\\ln\left(kL_0\right)$ to determine initial BOD $L_0$.

Computing $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}$ is not straightforward. Consider the plot below titled "Idealized oxygen utilization curve."

If you were to determine $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(t)$ as the change between two points (dashed lines), which means:

$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(t) = \frac{y_{t+1} - y_{t}}{\Delta t}
$$

Then each $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(t)$ will have a wide variance, with some positive (the first dashed line between points in the above plot) and some negative (the second).

### Best way to determine $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(t)$

However, we see that the generalized trend of $y$ over time in the "Idealized oxygen utilization curve" plot is increasing toward an asymptote. **The best way to determine $\frac{\partial y}{\partial t}(t)$** therefore is to plot a best-fit curve and take the tangent of that curve at different points in time.

## Determining theoretic BOD, c-BOD, and n-BOD

Theoretic BOD (or Total BOD) is the sum of carbonaceous BOD (cBOD) and nitrogenous BOD (nBOD) such that:

$$
BOD_{tot} = cBOD + nBOD
$$

To determine $BOD_{tot}$ for a given input molecule, solve a stochiometric mass balance.

### Example BOD calculation for Propanol

Suppose your input molecule is proponol, with chemical equation

$$
\text{Propanol:}\;\ce{C3H7OH}
$$

Then write the mass balance

$$
\ce{\mathbf{A}C3H7OH + \mathbf{B}O2 -> \mathbf{C}CO2 + \mathbf{D}H2O}
$$

And solve for stochiometric coefficients A,B,C, and D by balancing Carbon, then Oxygen, then Hydrogen. For propanol we arrive at the following stochiometric coefficients:

$$
\ce{C3H7OH + {4.5}O2 -> 3CO2 + 4H2O}
$$

This stochiometric balance can be converted to BOD by computing the respective masses of required $\ce{O2}$ and propanol:

$$
BOD_{tot,propanol} = \frac{4.5\;\text{mol}\times32\;\text{g/mol} \ce{O2}}{(3;\text{mol C}\times12\text{g/mol C})+(7;\text{mol H}\times1\text{g/mol H})+(1;\text{mol O}\times16\text{g/mol O})+(1;\text{mol H}\times1\text{g/mol H})}
$$
