Of words, which teaching you did give so free  
To those your students, discovering fresh  
The worlds, adventures, dreams on printed leaves,  
Coursing old paths across broad waters deep,  
Through passions, wars, intrigues, and minds of men,  
Over beside the stream of time and change,  
There are not now enough to speak to your  
Colossal soul, poured out in many acts  
Of true, complete, and patient sacrifice,  
Self-deprecation, self-forgetfulness,  
For children, husband, home, to be woman  
Whose life bold printed on eternal page  
Tells stories no less epic and complete,  
Odysseys no less courageous and long,  
Than the longsuffering son of Laertes,  
No less sweet than Orfeo‚Äôs winsome tune,  
As gracious as Valjean‚Äôs forgiving hand,  
Your life‚Äôs great work, far greater than these works,  
Or any written long before or since,  
Echoes in branches of your family‚Äôs tree,  
Sounding love, your children for each other,  
And faith, though faith was sometimes hard to find,  
Like that good father, ‚Äúhelp my unbelief!‚Äù  
You cried, your church had turned its back and cast  
Your husband and yourself on the wayside,  
And yet you persisted, covered by great grace  
To seek God‚Äôs face despite the trials you knew  
And find anew sweet rest in His designs,  
Who knew! Girl from Scottdale Pennsylvania,  
From early age half-orphaned and without  
A mother‚Äôs warm embrace, you grew in grace  
Seasoned with sharpest intellect and fire  
To seek, to know, to read, to grow, to find,  
You sang and danced your way into the heart  
Of dashing husband, man made of strong mind,  
Promising a missionary life, he,  
And you, set out together to reap souls  
In these confusing, weary, latter-days,  
But found that other paths before you lay  
And took to teaching, him his history  
And you your literature, your words and books,  
Now children in the wings, now house new built,  
Now debt, now hardship, now sorrow, now pain,  
The difficult years went, and new ones came,  
Slowly, but gently, like buds on a branch  
Which, waiting through the frosts innumerable  
Suddenly, at hour inexplicable,  
Reveal the fruit of patience, and sweetly  
Bloom, the wisdom of longsuffering shown true  
In blossoms bearing scents of Spring aloft,  
So too, the patience born in long, hard years  
Bloomed into love steadfast and true at end  
Of husband‚Äôs life ‚Äì now yours is here, and see  
How love which bloomed through you has borne in these  
Your children a love for one another, and for you  
Which, like the leaves of Spring, are not shaken,  
Despite the storms of life which do not cease,  
Though now you go to know the single place  
Where all is rest, all grace, all sight, all peace.  
  
Love borne in patience has much patience wrought,  
For to the end, you have the good fight fought.
