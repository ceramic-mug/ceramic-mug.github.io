The mighty Ohio, whose swift passage  
Herds West behemoths full of darkest coal  
Away from comely seams soft buried there  
Beneath the ancient Appalachian hill,  
Formed unknowingly a veil between the  
Girl cradled North in peaceful Chesapeake  
And the boy who settled South of silt shore  
In Huntington, where they would fateful meet  
One Autumnal day. Here begins their tale,  
Both students of Luke and Hippocrates  
While studying the cell’s anatomies,  
They once took respite from infinite leaves  
In conversation, soon discovering  
The melodies their hearts unknowingly  
Had, apart, been stepping to, in studies,  
Paths, and future plans, in faith, and by God’s  
Sovereign hands, both loving life in like ways,  
By grace longing to serve a hurting world.  
One evening he, after frisbee, felt soft  
Strung in his soul the mythic chord of love  
With tamber kin to David’s soothing lyre  
Which calms the restless spirits of a man  
And asked her on a date, though when or where  
He had not planned – he did not think he’d get  
That far – and so, that week, their love began,  
In walks, o’er coffee and Mongolian beef,  
To find articulation sweet, and legs  
On which to stand abreast the hull of hope  
That cuts the stormy waves of earthly life  
Which sometimes dupe seafaring men to toss  
Their precious cargo overboard for hope  
Of safer passage by their lonely strength,  
Their love grew roots through motorcycle rides,  
Long conversations leaning on the car  
While dying rays of golden light caught fire  
Her curly locks of hair and swept the dark  
Shades of his heart under her gracious gaze  
To be forgiven, loved, and healed by grace;  
They found fast friends and with them then explored  
Rocks of Seneca, Falling Waters Black,  
Wild Dolly Sods under twin Ursas’ light,  
Adventured far to Mayan lands, returned  
In blizzard-shrouded trip, the more in love,  
And held each other’s hurt when Grandmas died,  
Both learning how to dry the other’s tears  
And share the pain, the memories, the fears  
Of human heart – companionship’s sweet balm,  
Magnified joy in shared experience,  
To understand and be deep understood,  
For grace to always have the final word –  
The elements of lifelong partnership  
Distilling one by one into mortars  
Of Hope, compounded with immortal Faith  
And condensed into a greater Love by  
Atomic rules of Heaven’s alchemy –  
Great mystery! This girl from Chesapeake  
And he, from across the strong Ohio,  
Covenanting with one another on  
Third of October – when the trees which dress  
In mottled emerald, upon inclines  
Of ancient clay, don clothes of festival  
With yellow bangles, rouge, and cast their leaves  
Into the tributaries and streams which  
Run without end or fatigue into deep  
Waters, trusting timeless streams carved slowly  
Into the stubborn rocks and hills of ore,  
Like love’s patient artistry on the steep  
Geographies of the heart, supplied by   
Sweet Living Water’s all-enduring spring –  
Joshua and Anna’s matrimony.  
  
For life’s unknowns which form the greater part,  
They found the one with whom to trust their heart.
