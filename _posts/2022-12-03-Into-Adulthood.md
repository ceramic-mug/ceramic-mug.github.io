When failing I  
Find that indeed  
My heart is not  
So strong or brave  
As I believed;  
My speech not sweet  
Or patience great  
Enough to make  
All people happy  
All the time;  
I find that when  
I honest see  
Myself in light  
Of God’s majesty  
I, smaller true  
Than I once thought  
Can greater drink  
From grace’s cup  
And on that grace  
Rely in deeper  
And life-giving way;  
My childish mind  
Believes that I  
Through my own strength  
Unfailing can  
Without a trouble  
Or a loss  
Rise to become  
That man which  
God calls me to be;  
You see,  
As I now become  
A man  
I know that nothing  
Is so easy;  
Though greatest life  
And greatest opportunities  
Have been afforded me,  
It is not my past  
Nor future even  
That defines eternity;  
But present reliance  
On God’s grace;  
Present strength and courage  
From him derived;  
Present receipt of  
Promised communion  
And collaboration  
With the Galilean;  
If in himself  
A man’s hope lies  
Then to himself  
His broken ways  
Will always be  
Before his eyes;  
But if in freedom  
True at last  
A man on Christ  
Does fully cast  
His sorrow and his failures he  
May come to find  
Sweet sympathy  
Strong courage and  
Unshakably  
Such man can live  
Full faithfully  
Not swerving to  
The left or right  
But girded for  
Life’s every fight;  
Such a man  
I long to be  
Not by my power  
Or certainty  
But by that blood  
Which purchased me  
And by the Spirit  
Leading free  
My broken heart  
From slavery  
Strengthening  
My weakened knees  
And holding on  
To my weak hands,  
Christs strength  
Is strength;  
Otherwise,  
All of mine  
Is frailty.
