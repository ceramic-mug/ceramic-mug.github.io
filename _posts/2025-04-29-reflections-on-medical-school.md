Modern medical education has distinct stages, each with unique challenges, adventures, freedoms, responsibilities, resources, and opportunities. These stages can be broadly defined as:

1. Pre-clinical didactics
2. Clinical rotations
3. Board exam dedicated
4. Residency application

In this essay, I endeavor to offer meaningful reflections on my experience in each of these stages. My goal is twofold: to peel back the curtain on what is otherwise an uniquely obtuse and strange experience for those who have not and will not experience medical education for themselves; and to encourage and, if possible, offer guidance and insight to those who find themselves ‚Äúdrinking from the firehose.‚Äù

## Pre-clinical didactics ‚Äî I know nothing, again

The first and second years of medical school are designed to teach you the foundational ‚Äúbasic science‚Äù of medicine. The curriculum at this stage includes the anatomy (parts of the body), physiology (the body‚Äôs normal function), pathology (disease and sickness), pharmacology (medicines and how they work), microbiology (bacteria, viruses, and other things that cause disease), and other domains of science that form the foundation of medical practice. All of these domains are explored in *exhaustive* detail. You, the student, are expected to recognize, memorize, and understand vase amounts of information, in order to build a functional cognitive model of the human body and things that commonly go wrong in states of disease. The end of this stage is the Step 1 exam, the first of two Step exams taken during medical school. Though pass-fail, the exam is comprehensive, which makes it remarkably difficult.

My experience in this pre-clinical didactic portion of my medical education was not painless. It was, from the beginning, humbling. I once again felt like I didn‚Äôt know *anything at all* and had to start from ground zero. Very few words were even familiar. All the pathogens, all the disease names, the drug names, the enzymes and pathways were new, unpronouncable, and numerous. Each bit of knowledge had ten, twelve, twenty other bits of knowledge, sometimes closely connected, sometimes disparately related, which had to be integrated into a full conceptual tapestry. The process was as much learning a new language ‚Äî necessary, yes, to navigate the waters of medical knowledge ‚Äî as it was learning and connecting the knowledge itself.

And the pace! Exams every couple of weeks. Some days, up to 8 hours of new lecture material. No time to orient oneself to, then learn, then encode, then practice recalling all of the information. No time to cover everything, it felt. Always behind, always pushing for that next, imminent exam.

In the first semester of my first year, I doubted whether medicine was the right path for me. Was the difficulty worth it? Why push so hard? Why not choose a simpler career that still enabled me to help others in meaningful ways? I remember many tearful conversations with my family, expressing my doubts and fears about choosing this path. Now, confidently, towards the end of my medical education I am exceedingly grateful for having stuck through the difficult, early times when the end result was so hard to see and so far away, gratification always delayed, always ephemeral. Now, being in the hospital, caring for patients with the knowledge the first and second years forced me to acquire, I am exceedingly grateful for the rigour, the depth, the ‚Äúin the weeds‚Äù-ness, of being blasted with that firehose of knowledge so that, little by little, I learned to imbibe and slowly became knowledgeable.

I encourage you, if you are beginning or in this stage of your medical education, to not give up hope or grow discouraged. Found and protect patterns of rest ‚Äî a day off every week, a walk in the afternoon, some video games in the evening ‚Äî to prevent your life from being solely bound up in your education. Learn to rest as well as you work. If you have a community of worship, be faithful to it and don‚Äôt skip participating in that community or the routine of worship for upcoming exam dates or lectures you haven‚Äôt covered yet. Continue to try different study tools until you find what works for you. Remind yourself, in times of discouragement, why you are pursuing this career. Find a friend to get into an exercise routine with. Be honest about the challenges you‚Äôre experiencing, but be disciplined not to complain consistently. Ask for help, seek tutoring, learn from those who have succeeded before you, use available tools, don‚Äôt try to re-invent the wheel. Above all ‚Äî take courage, have grace for yourself and others, and perservere. You can do it!
