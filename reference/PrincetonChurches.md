This is a list of local Princeton-area Churches as of January, 2021. I hope Christian students on Princeton's campus will be able to use this page to find and join a local Church.

The Churches listed are in no particular order.

# Within Mercer County and Plainsboro

The following Churches hold services within Mercer and Plainsboro counties and are therefore appropriate for on-campus students to attend during the Spring 2021 semester. This is according to Dean Boden's message:

> As for attending services off campus, yes, it is permitted once quarantine is over. But students must maintain the same safety practices that they commit to in the social contract, and the church must comply with all state regulations.

And the following line of the social contract

> Not travel outside of Mercer County or Plainsboro, New Jersey, for any reason from the
time I arrive in Princeton until the end of the semester
