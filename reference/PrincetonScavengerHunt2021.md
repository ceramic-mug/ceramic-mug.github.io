Welcome to the Princeton University 2021 Freshman Scavenger Hunt! As you look for the items on this list, please maintain proper social distancing, wear face-coverings, and travel in groups of no more than 5 people outdoors and no more than 3 people indoors.

Without further ado, let's begin!

# üèò Buildings

1. Past Edgar Allan, through the shadow of Lewis Seigler, and over three-of-these-and-you're-out-er stands the glassy-eyed, stone-faced facad√© of Henry Clay.
2. We sing in praise of old ___________
3. Small...? er, tiny...? er, short...? hall. Likes to hang out near the gym.
4. These upperclassman residential bees make short work of me without autocorrect, man oh man! Especially near Forbes!
5. It's ok, I guess. Ok. Really tall, and it's hard to comprehend all the numbers. Caught on fire from arson a couple of years ago.
6. Many tires went into the funding of this building, and many long hours have been spent here among the rows and rows of wisdom.
7. You've got a _______ in me, you've got a ______ in me! Can you build a good algorithm to crack this one?
8. This City in Ohio can't have a tower as pretty as the one named after it. Golf course on one side, grad college on the other, you can hear the bells from this campanile from Forbes and see it from the backyard!
9. A goose! A goose! Home of the made-to-order 3am coffee run. Don't miss your train!


# üóø Monuments

1. Topologically a donut, but kinda pointy tbh. You can see it on the way to financial services.
2. An actual dinosaur?! Really?! We have one of those?? (This one is indoors)
3. Splish splash, splish splash, SPIA! What's that in the middle?
3. Tiger statue design 1
4. Tiger statue design 2
5. Tiger statue design 3
6. Like a keychain ring that you've stretched a little too much
7. The RIBOSOME. Look to the giant shutters for guidance. (This one is indoors)
8. Look twice at Double Sights. Then splash around in the nearby pool.
9. Maybe related to Reese Witherspoon, but likes to put his books on an eagle
10. These gates fitz like a glove!
