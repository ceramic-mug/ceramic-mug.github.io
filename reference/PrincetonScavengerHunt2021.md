# üèò Buildings

1. Past Edgar Allan, through the shadow of Lewis Seigler, and over three-of-these-and-you're-out-er stands the glassy-eyed, stone-faced facad√© of Henry Clay.
2. We sing in praise of old [xxxxxx]. Oldest building on campus, and most iconic.
3. Small...? er, tiny...? er, short...? hall. Likes to hang out near the gym.
4. This upperclassmen housing unit is one of the most desirable places to live on campus. Can you spell it right, man?
5. It's ok, I guess. Ok. Really tall, and it's hard to comprehend all the numbers. Caught on fire from arson a couple of years ago.
6. Flame bricks. named after the tire and rubber mogul. Many long student-hours have been spent here among the rows and rows of knowledge.
7. You've got a [xxxxxx] in me, you've got a [xxxxxx] in me! Can you build a good algorithm to crack this one?
8. This City in Ohio can't have a tower as pretty as the one named after it. Golf course on one side, grad college on the other, you can hear the bells from this campanile from Forbes and see it from the backyard!
9. A goose! A goose! Home of the made-to-order 3am coffee run. Don't miss your train!
10. According to Wikipedia, "A judicial court of chancery." And green! Look up and see the most beautiful stained-glass ceiling. Octagonal? Hexagonal? I don't know, but it's pretty amidst the quiet sounds of study. 
11. Yew-store! In the shadow of Blair lies your go-to shopping spot, with milk, eggs, toothpaste, deoderant, coffee, etc. Need something for your dorm? This is the first place to look!
12. North, South, West, ______ + a kind of tree.


# üóø Monuments

3. Splish splash, splish splash, SPIA! What's that in the middle?
3. Tiger statue 1. Likes to watch football.
4. Tiger statue 2. Flanks the old hall steps.
5. Tiger statue 3. Don't forget your wig!
6. Like a keychain ring that you've stretched a little too much. By Whitman
7. The RIBOSOME. Look to the giant shutters for guidance. (This one is indoors)

2. Shares its name with the most annoying Disney World ride, but great coffee and good vibes
3. Don't get lost in here! Lots of books and school supplies. Thankfully, no minotaur at the center.
4. Sub-sandwich Heaven? No, but close. Some darn good sandwiches. Try their sanchez sauce!
5. Mules used to use this road to pull ships along the canal. Great for running, walking, and goes a long, long way! Right by the water, and rumorhas it that it goes all the way to Trenton.
6. Well that's convenient! Check out the cheap prices for day-to-day necessities in the newest shop on Nassau, near Panera.
