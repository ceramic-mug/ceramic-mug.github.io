Welcome to the Princeton University 2021 Freshman Scavenger Hunt! As you look for the items on this list, please maintain proper social distancing, wear face-coverings, and travel in groups of no more than 5 people outdoors and no more than 3 people indoors.

This scavenger hunt was developed by Joshua Eastman, '22 CEE and Forbes RCA, and is not officially endorsed by the University.

Without further ado, let's begin!

# üèò Buildings

1. Past Edgar Allan, through the shadow of Lewis Seigler, and over three-of-these-and-you're-out-er stands the glassy-eyed, stone-faced facad√© of Henry Clay.
2. We sing in praise of old [xxxxxx]
3. Small...? er, tiny...? er, short...? hall. Likes to hang out near the gym.
4. These upperclassman residential bees make short work of me wihout autocorrect, man oh man! Especially near Forbes!
5. It's ok, I guess. Ok. Really tall, and it's hard to comprehend all the numbers. Caught on fire from arson a couple of years ago.
6. Many tires went into the funding of this building, and many long hours have been spent here among the rows and rows of knowledge. Don't yell this in a crowded theatre.
7. You've got a [xxxxxx] in me, you've got a [xxxxxx] in me! Can you build a good algorithm to crack this one?
8. This City in Ohio can't have a tower as pretty as the one named after it. Golf course on one side, grad college on the other, you can hear the bells from this campanile from Forbes and see it from the backyard!
9. A goose! A goose! Home of the made-to-order 3am coffee run. Don't miss your train!
10. According to Wikipedia, "A judicial court of chancery." And green! Look up and see the most beautiful stained-glass ceiling. Octagonal? Hexagonal? I don't know, but it's pretty amidst the quiet sounds of study. 


# üóø Monuments

1. Topologically a donut, but kinda pointy tbh. You can see it on the way to financial services.
2. An actual dinosaur?! Really?! We have one of those?? (This one is indoors)
3. Splish splash, splish splash, SPIA! What's that in the middle?
3. Tiger statue 1. Likes to watch football.
4. Tiger statue 2. Flanks the old hall steps.
5. Tiger statue 3. Don't forget your wig!
6. Like a keychain ring that you've stretched a little too much. By Whitman
7. The RIBOSOME. Look to the giant shutters for guidance. (This one is indoors)
8. Look twice at Double Sights. Then splash around in the nearby pool.
9. Maybe related to Reese Witherspoon, but likes to put his books on an eagle
10. These gates fitz like a glove!

# üè¢ Town and Around

1. Middle of your hand, but square, with some nice greenery and surrounded by small-town shops
2. Shares its name with the most annoying Disney World ride, but great coffee and good vibes
3. Don't get lost in here! Lots of books and school supplies. Thankfully, no minotaur at the center.
4. Sub-sandwich Heaven? No, but close. Some darn good sandwiches. Try their sanchez sauce!
5. Toe road. Mules used to pull ships along here. Great for running, walking, and goes a long, long way! Right by the water.
6. The strangest little Einstein museum lives in the back of this clothing store
7. Crooked fork? Squished knife? No, that's not it... But it has the best ice-cream around
8. Liberry liberry lend me a free parking pass please! Great study rooms in this public book-house.
9. MASSIVE monument to G-dub and the revolutionary war, close to Einstein's disembodied head and a dude reading a newspaper
