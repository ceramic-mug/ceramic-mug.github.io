What are my goals?

1. To compare pediatric cancer rates in Logan, WV with other counties in WV and across the United States

This first goal is to investigate claims of high pediatric cancer burdens in Logan. The first null hypothesis for this investigation is that there is no difference between pediatric cancer burden in Logan and other WV counties. The second null hypothesis is that there is no difference between pediatric cancer burden in Logan and USA at large.
