Why is it so hard when we see others succeed at things we struggle at? Why do we scream *injustice!* on the inside whenever someone gets something we think we deserve more than them? Why do we immediately list all of the reasons why they are a terrible choice for the job or the team and why we are so much better? Why do we do this?

## My Mind, the Accuser

I wager---and this is a bold wager in secular society---that these are the knee-jerk tendencies of everyone reading this post. These are also, of course, thoughts and feelings that I fight on a regular basis. These insecure habits of mind are banes of my soul--shards of glass that cut and mar my internal thought life.

I struggle to be happy for others when they succeed. When someone gets the position or the placement I hoped for, and I don't, I'm quick to tear that person down in my heart. While I tear them down, I build myself up and enumerate all the many ways I'm better, smarter, more equipped than they. Why wasn't I chosen instead of them? Didn't the administrator *see* that I'm so much better?

After my heart boasts to itself and glories in the insufficiencies of others, my thoughts tend to take a dark turn towards myself as well. I begin to wonder what about me isn't good enough. I begin to think about how I walk, how I talk, the things I say, the way I spend my time. The ways I relate to people or fail to relate to people. Do I talk to the *right* people? Do I spend my time doing the *right* things? Maybe if I were taller. Maybe if I changed my beliefs. Maybe if I got in line with the culture around me. Maybe then I would have gotten that position. Maybe then I would succeed. My thoughts accuse and condemn me.

My mind is not my friend most of the time. It is an enemy and a rebel, quick to revolutionary action on behalf of no one in particular. I cannibalize myself in the moment of tearing others down. I accuse everyone---including myself---of every evil, every injustice, and every ugliness.

Much of the time, my mind is an accuser.

## General Thoughts About Insecurity

Insecurity like mine is not a modern plague. I believe it's ancient. Modern technologies and lifestyles may exacerbate our individual internal struggles in some ways, but people are no different at their core today than they ever were.

When we tear our neighbors down unjustly, out of envy, we're participating in a story as old as humanity itself. We have always done this. There's nothing unique or new about insecurity in our modern era.

Insecurity is often one of the driving motivators behind the oppressor's tyranny. Insecurity is a major cause of grossly consumeristic and wasteful materialism. Insecurity lies behind genocide, murder, suicide, and any one of the destructive tiny actions we make towards one another and towards ourselves every day.

Our Insecurity screams *you are not good enough* at everyone we pass on the street. Our insecurity also screams *you are not good enough* at us. We end up neither trusting others nor ourselves and prefer the solitude of Entertainment to the hard work of heart renovation or interpersonal reconciliation.

Insecurity breaks relationships. I believe it is, ultimately, the result of a broken relationship. Specifically, our relationship as created beings with our Creator. Or, morse simply, our relationship with God.

Whether or not you believe this to be true, I wager---and it is a bold wager in secular society---that you are acquainted with insecurity. You may believe that insecurity, like every conscious or emotional reality, is evolutionarily advantageous. It helps us compete for resources and territory, as individuals and perhaps as a species.

I don't intend to take on secular evolutionary philosophy in the scope of this blog post. I only hope to offer an alternative theory on insecurity---a theory that is consistent, explanatory, and predictive, and that I have learned to trust and believe.

My theory of insecurity is not *my* theory of insecurity. It's ancient. Specifically, it's the theory that the *bad things* that we know to be destructive to ourselves and all of our relationships---be they with people or with any part of the universe---can all be summed up in a unified concept. That is, the *bad things* are all what Christians call *sin*.

## A Quick Apology for the Word *Sin*

This ancient theory of sin is not the one secular society constructs and projects onto the word. When secular society hears or uses the word, it usually intends to create a mental image of moralists eager to condemn people for any number of actions or lifestyles. More often than not, secular *sin* is a euphemism for an imagined fundamentalists' wrong, unjust, and oppressive moral constructs.

This connotation of the word *sin* is unhelpful for many reasons, but in large part because it stifles any conversation around the word and concept. Moral wrong as a concept is taboo, and the word *sin* has been made synonymous with moral wrong and thereby become a taboo.

Whether or not you agree with this short and uninformed apology for using the word *sin* I ask that you attempt to be conscious of and relinquish your connotations for the sake of openly attending to my argument. After you finish reading, you are free to discard my argument and resume your connotations.

## A Biblical Introduction to Sin and Insecurity

I do not have theological training, and I don't have an exhaustive knowledge of the Christian Bible or human history. I'm sure that some things I say will not be accurate and that my theory of sin has holes and substantial insufficiencies. Mine is the honest attempt of an interested party.

I also trust in God's grace, which is kind of the whole point of this blog post, so I'm not going to *not* attempt to write just because I know I'll make some mistakes. So here goes.

In short, I believe the Evangelical Christian theory that *sin* refers to states of broken relationship. The broader context of sin as broken relationship is that *all* broken relationships are a consequence of *a* primary broken relationship, i.e. a broken relationship with God. The Hebrew Bible, which constitutes the Christian Old Testament, describes God as Creator of the universe and everything in it but also, significantly, as a *person* who's very interested in humanity and made us specifically to have conscious and willful relationships with Him.

The story of Genesis first describes creation (Genesis 1 & 2) and spends a lot of time specifying humanity's special place in relationship to God and the rest of the created Universe.

*The very next story* is about how humanity breaks their original relationship with God. This is illustrated by Adam and Eve, the Biblical first man and woman, doing the one and only thing they were commanded not to do (Genesis 3). Then, Cain, son of Adam and Eve, kills Abel, his brother (Genesis 4).

This is pretty remarkable when you think about it. If you only consider the Bible secularly as an ancient book of cultural knowledge and wisdom, it's extremely significant that the fourth chapter contains homicide. What does this say about human beings?

And it's during this chapter that the Genesis story introduces the first of the Hebrew words that English Bible translators commonly render to "sin" (Genesis 4:7)---חַטָּאָה. The English Standard Version (ESV) translation of this verse reads:

> If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, **sin** [חַטָּאָה] is crouching at the door. Its desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it.

This quote is God speaking to Cain after he (Cain) kills his brother. Significantly, Cain chose to kill his brother *because God accepted his brother Abel's offering but not Cain's own*. The Biblical Cain killed his brother because he felt the same wave of anger and accusation that we all feel when someone gets something---especially the commendation of someone we look up to---and we don't. Cain was *insecure* in the same way that many of us are insecure. In the same way that I am insecure when I hear about the success of others.

It's no coincidence that the first use of the word *sin* in the Hebrew Bible is in the middle of a violent story that hinges on feelings of insecurity. And it's also no coincidence that this immediately follows the story of the Biblical first man and woman's rejection of God's commandments.

Of course, the word "sin"'s proximity to these stories doesn't necessarily yield any nice conclusion about the interrelatedness of sin and insecurity, as I'm attempting to argue. But I hope it at least makes you pause and consider for yourself what the implications of Cain's envy for the commendation his brother Abel received may mean for you and I and the thoughts we tend to have about our friends who succeed.

Hopefully, you will also consider the possibility that our understanding of sin may be better off informed by an ancient narrative and thousands of years of argument and conversation rather then modern philosophical conclusions that reject the ancients.

In any case, the story of Adam and Eve, and then of Cain and Abel, as people who broke relationships because of envy and *insecurity*, first with God and then with one another, is only the beginning of many similar stories in Genesis. I believe a careful scrutiny of all of the Hebrew Old Testament will reveal a consistent theme of *insecure* people committing violent acts on one another.

And those stories describe life multiple thousands of years ago.

Like I said at the beginning of this post, I don't think our current feelings of insecurity are anything new.

## Consequences of Accepting My Theory of Insecurity and Sin

As the story of Cain and Abel suggests in its proximity and chronology to Adam and Eve's initial rejection of God's commandments, I argue that it's Biblically consistent to believe the theory that *insecurity*, which we all feel and deal with, is ultimately a result of our rejection of God in our own lives. Feelings of envy, the accusatory voices in our head, and the desire to harm others to our own advantage---which we often define as insecurity---are as much products of Biblical sin as are the violent and destructive actions that result from those feelings.

Accepting this theory of insecurity and sin means that our understanding of sin must expand to include thoughts and feelings, not just actions. This is, not coincidentally, exactly how the man Jesus expands his followers' understanding of sin throughout his ministry (recorded in the Greek Biblical texts known as the Gospels). He speaks directly to the destructiveness of thoughts and feelings in his famous "Sermon on the Mount," which is recorded with slight variations across all the Gospels but in a very complete form in the book Matthew, chapters 5 through 7.

Accepting this theory of insecurity and sin means, on a personal level, that we address the feelings of envy, accusation, and despair that we have when we see others succeed with a different approach. It may not be enough to treat these internal hurts and destructive habits humanistically and biologically. If insecurity *is* in some way a product of sin, as my reading of Genesis 3 and 4 suggests, then insecurity can perhaps, in some way, be dealt with by dealing with sin.

What does it mean to deal with sin? And how dare you, the judgmental Christian blog writer, write off my internal problems and emotional struggles as a moral failure on my part?

## Dealing with Sin, i.e. Jesus

First, my relational definition of sin that I establish above is not *simply* about moral failure. I argue that at its core, sin is not moralistic at all. I argue that it's first relational,
