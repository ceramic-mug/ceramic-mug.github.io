The medical school admissions process is extremely difficult in a number of different ways. 

The medical school admissions process is academically difficult, requiring you to take a broad set of math and science courses as well as rigorous organic and biochemistry -- all during undergraduate years (unless you choose to take some courses post-baccelaureate).

The medical school admissions process is financially difficult: the MCAT (Medical College Admissions Test) costs around <span>$</span>300 dollars and good study materials cost ><span>$</span>200; AMCAS (the American Medical College Application Service) primary application costs <span>$</span>170 for the first school and <span>$</span>40 for additional schools (the average number of schools applied to is around 20, so <span>$</span>170 + 19 * <span>$</span>40 = <span>$</span>930); per-school secondary applications cost an average <span>$</span>95 (for 20 schools, that's a total of <span>$</span>1900). A normal (non-COVID) application cycle requires the applicant to travel to schools for interview, incurring hundreds of dollars of travel cost per interview. In all, the application process alone costs upwards of <span>$</span>3,500, not including travel costs.

The medical school admissions process is also time-intensive. Before applying, an applicant is expected to spend hundreds of hours job-shadowing physician(s), conducting research, doing community service, and working/volunteering in a clinical setting. An applicant will also study for hundreds of hours for the MCAT. The AMCAS primary application takes on the order of dozens of hours, and completing the full litany of secondary applications takes another set of dozens of hours. Interviews are the shortest part of the process, lasting from around 20 minutes to four hours per interview. In all, a medical school applicant will likely spend upwards of 500+ hours resume building (shadowing, conducting research, etc.), studying, and completing the application itself. This is usually on top of being a full-time undergraduate student.

All this is to say: the medical school admissions process is extremely difficult. I think it helps knowing what to expect before diving in so you can make appropriate plans.
